# Buffoonery 
A Balatro mod that aims to add vanilla-adjacent content while still having its own style.

*This mod currently adds 8 jokers to the game. There will be more jokers in the near future and other types of cards.*

## Jokers
![Readme1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d318ed-05e4-4a0a-8773-fbd0e9c7fd64)


From left to right:
+ *White Pony:* +3 Mult. Doubles each ante (uncommon)
+ *Rerollin':* Gives +$20 on your 5th reroll per shop (uncommon)
+ *Korny Joker:* Gives +50 Chips during Small Blind, +100 during Big Blind and +160 during Boss Blind. Hidden chance to get destroyed at the end of turn (common)
+ *Memory Card:* Memorizes the first card scored each round up to 8 times. When you sell it, converts each card in hand into a memorized one, in order (rare)
+ *Cashout Voucher:* If winning hand triples the Blind's requirement, this Joker gives 0,25% of that requirement as money and destroys itself. (common)

### v0.5.0 Update:
![Showcase0-5-0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/882db092-dc55-42da-99bb-328a11af2d1c)


From left to right:
+ Five Fingers: X2.5 Mult if you have exactly 5 jokers and scoring hand has exactly 5 cards
+ Laidback Joker: X2 Mult. -1 Joker Slot.
+ Pertinent Argument: When played hand is a two pair and has 5 cards, 1 in 2 chance of converting the unpaired card into a paired one.
