# Buffoonery 
A Balatro mod that aims to add vanilla-adjacent content while still having its own style.

*This mod currently adds 13 jokers to the game. Two more jokers are currently planned for release. There will be stuff other than Jokers in future updates*

## Jokers

+ *Memory Card:* Memorizes the first card scored each round up to 8 times. When you sell it, converts each card in hand into a memorized one, in order. (rare)
+ *Cashout Voucher:* If winning hand triples the Blind's requirement, this Joker gives 0,25% of that requirement as money and destroys itself. (common)
